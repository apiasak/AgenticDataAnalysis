## Recent Changes and Discoveries

### System Architecture Analysis
**Key Findings**:
- **LangGraph StateGraph**: Sophisticated agent orchestration with conditional routing
- **Persistent Python Environment**: Variables survive between tool calls for iterative analysis
- **Hybrid Visualization Storage**: JSON-first with pickle fallback for complex Plotly objects
- **Multi-tab Streamlit Interface**: Clean separation of data management, chat, and debug views

### Technical Patterns Identified
1. **State-Driven Agent Design**: Immutable state transitions with comprehensive tracking
2. **Sandboxed Code Execution**: Secure Python environment with limited library access
3. **Chunked Data Processing**: Scalability pattern for large dataset handling
4. **Graceful Error Handling**: Partial results and comprehensive logging

## Current System State

### Working Components
- **Streamlit Interface**: Fully functional multi-tab UI
- **File Upload System**: CSV handling with metadata management
- **LangGraph Agent**: Operational with GPT-4o integration
- **Python Execution**: Sandboxed environment with pandas, sklearn, plotly
- **Visualization Pipeline**: Automatic figure generation and storage
- **Data Dictionary**: Metadata management for uploaded datasets

### Configuration Status
- **OpenAI API**: Configured with environment variables (.env file)
- **Upload Limits**: 2GB maximum file size
- **Execution Limits**: 15 recursion limit, 5 max messages
- **Storage**: Local file system with organized directory structure

### Sample Data Available
Based on `data_dictionary.json`, the system has been tested with:
- **transactions_data.csv**: Financial transaction records (2010s era)
- **cards_data.csv**: Credit/debit card details
- **mcc_codes.csv**: Merchant category classification
- **train_fraud_labels.json**: Binary fraud classification labels
- **users_data.csv**: Customer demographic information
- **Segment_Data.csv**: Additional segmentation data

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **LangGraph over LangChain**: Better state management and debugging
2. **Streamlit over Gradio/Flask**: Rapid development and Python integration
3. **Local Storage over Database**: Simplicity for MVP/demo purposes
4. **JSON/Pickle Hybrid**: Reliability for complex visualization objects

### Current Design Trade-offs
- **Single-user vs Multi-user**: Chose simplicity over scalability
- **Local vs Cloud Storage**: Development convenience over production readiness
- **Synchronous vs Async**: Simpler implementation over performance
- **Environment Variables**: ✅ Implemented secure credential management

### Open Technical Questions
1. **Scalability**: How to handle multiple concurrent users?
2. **Persistence**: Should analysis state survive browser sessions?
3. **Security**: Production-ready API key management approach?
4. **Performance**: Optimization strategies for large datasets?

## Next Steps and Priorities

### Immediate Tasks (Current Session)
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish progress.md documentation
2. **Create .clinerules**: Document project-specific patterns and preferences
3. **Validate System**: Ensure all components are properly documented

### Short-term Development (Next Sessions)
1. **Security Hardening**: Environment variable API key management
2. **Error Handling**: Improve user feedback for failed operations
3. **Performance Testing**: Validate with larger datasets
4. **Documentation**: User guide and deployment instructions

### Medium-term Enhancements
1. **Multi-dataset Relationships**: Automatic join detection and suggestions
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Statistical testing and model evaluation
3. **Export Capabilities**: PDF reports and presentation formats
4. **Collaboration Features**: Shareable analysis sessions

## Development Context

### Current Development Environment
- **Platform**: macOS development environment
- **Python Version**: 3.x with modern package versions
- **IDE**: VSCode with multiple tabs open for analysis
- **Testing**: Manual testing with sample financial datasets

### Key Files Currently Open
- `data_analysis_streamlit_app.py`: Main application entry point
- `Pages/python_visualisation_agent.py`: Primary UI implementation
- `Pages/backend.py`: Core agent logic and LangGraph orchestration
- `Pages/graph/nodes.py`: Agent node implementations
- `Pages/graph/tools.py`: Python execution tool
- Various memory bank documentation files

### Recent Code Analysis Insights
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management with partial results
- **Flexible Data Loading**: Automatic dataset naming and relationship detection
- **Sophisticated Logging**: Structured logging throughout execution pipeline
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between UI, agent logic, and execution

## User Experience Considerations

### Current UX Strengths
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear tab-based organization
- **Transparent Process**: Debug view shows AI reasoning
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Plotly charts with full interactivity
- **Iterative Analysis**: Conversation-based exploration

### Known UX Limitations
- **Single Session**: No cross-session persistence
- **Limited File Types**: CSV-only data input
- **Local Deployment**: Requires technical setup
- **API Dependency**: Requires OpenAI API access

### User Feedback Integration
- **Data Dictionary**: User-editable dataset descriptions
- **Chat Interface**: Natural language query processing
- **Debug Transparency**: Visible intermediate steps
- **Error Communication**: Clear error messages and guidance

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### Current Technical Debt
1. ✅ **API Key Security**: Moved to environment variables (.env file)
2. **Local File Storage**: Not scalable for multi-user deployment
3. **Synchronous Processing**: Blocks UI during long operations
4. **Limited Error Recovery**: Some failure modes not gracefully handled

### Planned Improvements
1. **Environment Configuration**: Secure credential management
2. **Async Processing**: Non-blocking analysis execution
3. **Enhanced Validation**: Better input sanitization and error prevention
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics and alerting for production use

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies
