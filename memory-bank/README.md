# Memory Bank - Agentic Data Analysis

## Overview

This memory bank contains comprehensive documentation for the Agentic Data Analysis project - an AI-powered data analysis system built with LangGraph and Streamlit. The system has evolved from a basic proof-of-concept to a production-ready platform with enterprise-level capabilities.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of required core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]
    
    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
    
    AC --> P[progress.md]
