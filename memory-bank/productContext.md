# Product Context - Agentic Data Analysis

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Data analysis is a critical business function, but it's often gatekept by technical complexity:
- **Technical Barrier**: Traditional data analysis requires programming skills (Python, R, SQL)
- **Tool Complexity**: Existing tools like Jupyter notebooks intimidate non-technical users
- **Time Investment**: Learning data science takes months/years
- **Iteration Friction**: Each analysis question requires technical implementation
- **Context Loss**: Insights get lost between analysis sessions

### The Vision
Transform data analysis from a technical skill into a natural conversation. Enable anyone to:
- Ask sophisticated questions about their data in plain English
- Receive professional-grade analysis and visualizations
- Iterate and refine their understanding through dialogue
- Build cumulative insights within analysis sessions

## How It Should Work

```

### Core User Experience Principles

#### 1. **Conversational Intelligence**
- Users communicate in natural language, not code
- AI translates business questions into technical analysis
- Responses include both insights and reasoning

#### 2. **Transparent Process**
- Users see the AI's thought process
- Code execution is visible but not required knowledge
- Debug view shows intermediate steps

#### 3. **Iterative Refinement**
- Each question builds on previous analysis
- Variables and insights persist within sessions
- Users can drill down or pivot based on findings

#### 4. **Professional Quality**
- Analysis follows data science best practices
- Visualizations are publication-ready
- Insights include statistical context and limitations
