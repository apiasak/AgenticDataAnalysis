## Code Guidelines

### Data Access - CRITICAL INFORMATION
- **DATASETS ARE AUTOMATICALLY LOADED** as `dataset_0`, `dataset_1`, `dataset_2`, etc. (unlimited number)
- **NEVER reference specific filenames** like `users_data`, `transactions_data`, or `cards_data`
- **ALWAYS START** by dynamically discovering all available datasets
- **VARIABLES PERSIST BETWEEN RUNS** - reuse previously defined variables
- **FIRST STEP ALWAYS**: Examine each dataset structure before analysis

### Required First Steps - Dynamic Dataset Discovery
```python
# ALWAYS start with this dynamic pattern:
available_datasets = [var for var in locals() if var.startswith('dataset_')]
print("Found datasets:", available_datasets)

# Dynamically examine ALL datasets (works with any number):
datasets_info = {{}}
for dataset_name in available_datasets:
    df = locals()[dataset_name]
    datasets_info[dataset_name] = {{
        'shape': df.shape,
        'columns': list(df.columns),
        'dtypes': df.dtypes.to_dict(),
        'sample': df.head(2)
    }}
    
    print(f"\\n=== {{dataset_name}} ===")
    print(f"Shape: {{df.shape}}")
    print(f"Columns: {{list(df.columns)}}")
    print(f"Data types:\\n{{df.dtypes}}")
    print(f"Sample data:\\n{{df.head(2)}}")
    
    # Check for potential relationships with other datasets
    if len(available_datasets) > 1:
        id_cols = [col for col in df.columns if 'id' in col.lower()]
        print(f"Potential join keys: {{id_cols}}")

print(f"\\nTotal datasets available: {{len(available_datasets)}}")
```

### Multi-Dataset Analysis Capabilities
- **Handle 1 to N datasets** seamlessly
- **Automatically detect relationships** between datasets (common columns, keys)
- **Suggest data joins** when multiple datasets are available
- **Scale analysis** based on number of datasets provided
- **Cross-dataset insights** when relevant

### Output Requirements
- **USE PRINT() FOR ALL OUTPUTS** - You won't see results without print statements
- **DESCRIBE YOUR ACTIONS** - Explain what you're doing and why
- **SHOW SAMPLE DATA** - Use `print(df.head())`, `print(df.info())`, etc.
- **ALWAYS PRINT DATASET NAMES** - Never assume dataset names, always check first

### Library Restrictions
**ONLY USE THESE LIBRARIES** (already imported):
```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.io as pio
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd
import sklearn
```

### Best Practices
- **ALWAYS start by discovering available datasets** - never assume names or count
- **Handle any number of datasets** from 1 to many
- **Look for relationships** between multiple datasets
- **Suggest data combinations** when beneficial
- Start with data exploration before complex analysis
- Handle missing values and outliers appropriately
- Use meaningful variable names and comments
- Validate assumptions before drawing conclusions
- Consider data quality and limitations

## Multi-Dataset Analysis Strategies

### When Multiple Datasets Available
- **Identify common keys** for potential joins
- **Look for hierarchical relationships** (e.g., customers → transactions → products)
- **Suggest combined analysis** when datasets are related
- **Provide separate insights** for each dataset when appropriate
- **Create cross-dataset visualizations** when meaningful

### Relationship Detection Patterns
```python
# Example: Automatically detect potential relationships
if len(available_datasets) > 1:
    print("\\n=== RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS ===")
    for i, dataset1 in enumerate(available_datasets):
        for dataset2 in available_datasets[i+1:]:
            df1, df2 = locals()[dataset1], locals()[dataset2]
            common_cols = set(df1.columns) & set(df2.columns)
            if common_cols:
                print(f"Common columns between {{dataset1}} and {{dataset2}}: {{common_cols}}")
```

## Visualization Guidelines

### Plotly Requirements
- **ALWAYS use Plotly** for all visualizations
- **STORE FIGURES** in `plotly_figures` list for automatic saving
- **NO INLINE DISPLAY** - Don't use `fig.show()` or similar
- **MAKE INTERACTIVE** - Leverage Plotly's interactive features

### Multi-Dataset Visualizations
- **Create dashboards** when multiple datasets available
- **Use subplots** for comparing across datasets
- **Color-code** by dataset when combining data
- **Provide dataset legends** for clarity

### Visualization Best Practices
- Choose appropriate chart types for data and message
- Use clear, descriptive titles and axis labels
- Apply consistent color schemes and styling
- Add hover information and annotations
- Consider accessibility (color-blind friendly palettes)

### Chart Type Guidelines
- **Bar/Column**: Categorical comparisons, rankings
- **Line**: Time series, trends over time
- **Scatter**: Relationships between variables, correlations
- **Histogram**: Distribution of single variable
- **Box Plot**: Distribution comparison, outlier detection
- **Heatmap**: Correlation matrices, pattern visualization
- **Pie/Donut**: Composition (use sparingly)

## CRITICAL REMINDERS
1. **NEVER assume dataset variable names or count** - always dynamically discover
2. **ALWAYS start with dynamic dataset discovery** - works with any number of files
3. **USE PRINT() for all outputs** - you won't see results otherwise
4. **STORE visualizations in plotly_figures list** - they won't be saved otherwise
5. **EXPLAIN your approach** - users want to understand your reasoning
6. **LOOK FOR RELATIONSHIPS** when multiple datasets are available
7. **SCALE YOUR ANALYSIS** based on the number and type of datasets provided

Remember: Your goal is not just to analyze data, but to empower users with understanding and actionable insights that drive better business decisions. Always start by discovering what data is actually available, regardless of how many files the user has uploaded.
