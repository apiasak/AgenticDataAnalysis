#### Key Features Added:
```python
# User-friendly error conversion
def get_user_friendly_error(error_str, code):
    if "nameerror" in error_lower:
        return "❌ Dataset not found. Make sure you've uploaded and selected your data files."
    # ... more error types

# Progress indicators in UI
with st.spinner("🤖 Analyzing your data..."):
    progress_bar = st.progress(0)
    status_text = st.empty()
    # ... progress updates
```

### 2. **Smart Query Suggestions System** ⭐
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Medium

- **File-type awareness**: Different suggestions for transaction, customer, sales data
- **One-click queries**: Users can click suggestions to instantly run analysis
- **Beginner-friendly**: Reduces learning curve for new users

#### Files Modified:
- `Pages/python_visualisation_agent.py`: Added smart suggestion system

#### Key Features Added:
```python
def generate_smart_suggestions(selected_files):
    suggestions = ["📊 Show me a summary of my data"]
    
    for filename in selected_files:
        if 'transaction' in filename.lower():
            suggestions.extend([
                "💳 Analyze transaction patterns and trends",
                "🚨 Detect any fraudulent or unusual transactions"
            ])
    return suggestions[:6]
```

### 3. **Improved Visualization and Bug Fixes** ⭐

- **Fixed missing plotly import**: Resolved visualization display issues
- **Enhanced chart error handling**: Graceful fallback when charts fail to load
- **Better debug information**: Improved intermediate output display
- **Removed deprecated imports**: Updated to latest library versions

#### Files Modified:
- `Pages/python_visualisation_agent.py`: Fixed plotly import and chart display
- `Pages/graph/tools.py`: Removed deprecated PythonREPL import
- `requirements.txt`: Updated to latest compatible library versions

#### Key Features Added:
```python
# Fixed visualization display
try:
    if image_path.endswith('.json'):
        fig = pio.from_json(fig_json)
    else:
        fig = pickle.load(f)
    st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Error displaying chart: {str(e)}")
```

## 🚀 Additional Enhancements

### **Async Task Management Framework**
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (Foundation)
**Files Added**: 
- `Pages/utils/async_handler.py`: Background task processing framework
- `Pages/utils/__init__.py`: Utils module initialization

This provides the foundation for future async processing improvements.

### **Updated Dependencies**
