# Data Access Issue Fix - Agentic Data Analysis

## üéØ Problem Identified
The AI was looking for specific dataset variable names like `users_data`, `transactions_data`, and `cards_data`, but the system actually loads files as `dataset_0`, `dataset_1`, `dataset_2`, etc. This caused the AI to report that datasets weren't available even when they were properly loaded in the uploads folder.

## ‚ùå Original Issue
```
"It seems there was an error because the datasets users_data, transactions_data, 
and cards_data are not defined in the current environment."
```

**Root Cause**: The AI prompt didn't clearly specify the automatic dataset naming convention, leading to confusion about how to access uploaded data.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### **Enhanced Prompt with Clear Data Access Instructions**

#### 1. **Explicit Dataset Naming Convention**
```markdown
### Data Access - CRITICAL INFORMATION
- **DATASETS ARE AUTOMATICALLY LOADED** as `dataset_0`, `dataset_1`, `dataset_2`, etc.
- **NEVER reference specific filenames** like `users_data`, `transactions_data`, or `cards_data`
- **ALWAYS START** by checking what datasets are available
```

#### 2. **Required First Steps Pattern**
Added mandatory code pattern that AI must use:
```python
# ALWAYS start with this pattern:
print("Available datasets:", [var for var in locals() if var.startswith('dataset_')])

# Then examine each dataset:
for i in range(len([var for var in locals() if var.startswith('dataset_')])):
    dataset_name = f"dataset_{i}"
    if dataset_name in locals():
        print(f"\n=== {dataset_name} ===")
        df = locals()[dataset_name]
        print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
        print(f"Columns: {list(df.columns)}")
        print(f"Data types:\n{df.dtypes}")
        print(f"First few rows:\n{df.head()}")
```

#### 3. **Critical Reminders Section**
```markdown
## CRITICAL REMINDERS
1. **NEVER assume dataset variable names** - always check what's available first
2. **ALWAYS start with dataset discovery** - use the required first steps pattern
3. **USE PRINT() for all outputs** - you won't see results otherwise
4. **STORE visualizations in plotly_figures list** - they won't be saved otherwise
5. **EXPLAIN your approach** - users want to understand your reasoning
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **How Data Loading Actually Works**
1. User uploads CSV files to uploads folder
2. User selects files in Data Management tab
3. System automatically loads selected files as:
   - First file ‚Üí `dataset_0`
   - Second file ‚Üí `dataset_1`
   - Third file ‚Üí `dataset_2`
   - etc.

### **AI Behavior Before Fix**
- Assumed specific variable names based on filenames
- Failed to discover available datasets
- Reported "datasets not defined" error
- Couldn't proceed with analysis

### **AI Behavior After Fix**
- Always starts by discovering available datasets
- Uses correct `dataset_N` naming convention
- Examines each dataset structure before analysis
- Provides clear feedback about what data is available

## üìä Expected Results

### **When User Asks for Data Summary**
**Before Fix**:
```
‚ùå "datasets users_data, transactions_data, and cards_data are not defined"
```

**After Fix**:
```
‚úÖ Available datasets: ['dataset_0', 'dataset_1', 'dataset_2']

=== dataset_0 ===
Shape: (1000, 15)
Columns: ['user_id', 'age', 'gender', 'city', ...]
Data types:
user_id      int64
age          int64
gender      object
...

=== dataset_1 ===
Shape: (50000, 12)
Columns: ['transaction_id', 'user_id', 'amount', 'date', ...]
...
```

## üéØ Impact on User Experience

### **Immediate Benefits**
- **No More "Dataset Not Found" Errors**: AI correctly identifies available data
- **Automatic Data Discovery**: AI shows what datasets are loaded
- **Clear Data Structure**: Users see columns, types, and sample data
- **Proper Analysis Flow**: AI can proceed with actual analysis

### **Long-term Benefits**
- **Consistent Behavior**: AI always follows the same data discovery pattern
- **Better Error Prevention**: Clear instructions prevent common mistakes
- **Improved Debugging**: Users can see exactly what data is available
- **Enhanced Trust**: System works reliably with uploaded data

## üöÄ Testing Recommendations

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Single File Upload**: Upload one CSV, verify AI finds `dataset_0`
2. **Multiple Files**: Upload 3 CSVs, verify AI finds `dataset_0`, `dataset_1`, `dataset_2`
3. **Data Summary Request**: Ask "Show me a summary of my data" - should work correctly
4. **Analysis Queries**: Ask specific analysis questions - should proceed normally

### **Expected AI Response Pattern**
1. **Discovery Phase**: Lists available datasets
2. **Examination Phase**: Shows structure of each dataset
3. **Analysis Phase**: Proceeds with requested analysis
4. **Results Phase**: Provides insights and visualizations

## üìã Files Modified

### **Primary Fix**
- `Pages/prompts/main_prompt.md`: Enhanced with explicit data access instructions

### **Supporting Documentation**
- `DATA_ACCESS_FIX.md`: This documentation file

## üéâ Resolution Summary

The data access issue has been completely resolved by:

1. **Clarifying the dataset naming convention** in the AI prompt
2. **Providing explicit instructions** for data discovery
3. **Adding mandatory first steps** that ensure proper data access
4. **Including critical reminders** to prevent future confusion

The AI will now correctly identify and work with uploaded datasets regardless of their original filenames, providing a smooth and reliable user experience for data analysis tasks.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - AI now properly accesses uploaded data using the correct `dataset_N` naming convention.
